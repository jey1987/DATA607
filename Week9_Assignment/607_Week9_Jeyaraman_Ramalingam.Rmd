## JSON - Read Approach

1. Created signin under api nyc website.
2. Created API Key for myAPP
3. Authorized Movie Reviews API with the key
4. Used the URL call and API Key for bringing JSON into R environment
5. Created and Displayed the dataframe

```{r json_eval, eval=TRUE}
url <- "https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/picks.json"
search_string <- "godfather"
key <- "V3q6edKvlzzQHotsgCC8V77LPZBMcxeY"

final_url <- paste0(url,"?&api-key=",key)


review <- fromJSON(final_url)
review_DF <- data.frame(review)
review_DF

```
