## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r eval=TRUE}

library(RMySQL)

mydb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password='root', dbname='sys', host='localhost')
rs = dbSendQuery(mydb, "select * from review_movies")
data = fetch(rs,n=-1)
data

```
