```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r formats, eval=TRUE}
fileURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jey1987/DATA607/master/Week7_Assignment/books.json"
jsonURL <- getURL(fileURL)

fileURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jey1987/DATA607/master/Week7_Assignment/books.xml"
xmlURL <- getURL(fileURL)

fileURL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jey1987/DATA607/master/Week7_Assignment/books.html"
htmlURL <- getURL(fileURL)

df_JSON <- fromJSON(jsonURL)
df_XML <- xmlToDataFrame(xmlURL)
df_HTML <- readHTMLTable(htmlURL)

df_JSON

df_XML

df_HTML
```

The three dataframes are not identical. HTML and JSON are of type List, XML is of format table. The data retrieved is also different.
