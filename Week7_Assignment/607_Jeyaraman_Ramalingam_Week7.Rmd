```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(XML)
library(rjson)
```

```{r formats, eval=TRUE}

df_JSON <- fromJSON(file="C:/Users/jey19/Desktop/books.json")
df_XML <- xmlToDataFrame("C:/Users/jey19/Desktop/books.xml")
df_HTML <- readHTMLTable("C:/Users/jey19/Desktop/books.html")

df_JSON

df_XML

df_HTML
```

The three dataframes are not identical. HTML and JSON are of type List, XML is of format table. The data retrieved is also different.
